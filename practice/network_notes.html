		<h2>Network Problems Experienced</h2>
		<p><strong>Problem:</strong> The computers in the middle were being overwhelmed with papers and could not get them all out.<br><strong>Solution:</strong> Each computer had to wait 30 seconds before sending another packet into the network, to make sure no one was overwhelmed.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Problem:</strong> The packets were coming out of order and it was difficult for some computers to put the pieces together<br><strong>Solution:</strong> Each packet had a written note on it saying where it goes in regards to the whole file.</p>
		<br>
