		<p>This recipe is also a family recipe. Someone (I believe either my mother or grandmother found this recipe in the magazine.) My family would make this every christmas to leave out for Santa as well as enjoy ourselves. <q>I liked them a lot, but I do not like chocolate, so I would eat them without the chocolate kiss</q> <cite>-Kaitlyn</cite><!--My sister--></p>

		<h2>YIELD: 4 dozen</h2><!--Family recipe my (believe grandmother) found in a magazine. By the Pillsbury Company-->
		<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Make one inch ball and measure it, then use that ball as an example for all the others</li>
			<li>It is best to use the original chocolate pieces, fancy flavors usually cause problems</li>
			<li>Place the chocolate pieces right after the cookies come out of the oven so that the chocolate pieces will melt</li>
		</ul>
